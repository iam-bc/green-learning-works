Notes on Drupify. analysis of its constituent parts

colors:
 menu buttons           7ea702 (medium yellow green)
                        c9ef50 (pale yellow green)
arrow buttons are on transparent background (not so great for IE) besides which they are a bit dorky              
                                 
background is a gradient smoky blue 5973a4 (dark) to accbfd (light)-- could reuse the gif or change its color (keeping gradient) using color replace in photoshop.       

header background also a gradient -- do we want to change the background of the new GWL logo to a gradient?
                             
footer is kind of cool. left and right images specify the rounded edges of actual footer and its apparent shadow. 
                             
                             
framework: doesn't use grid system -- page is slightly smaller than 960. 
   main node takes up 11 grid. right column the remaining 5.
